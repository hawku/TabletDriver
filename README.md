This is a low latency graphics tablet driver that is meant to be used with rhythm game [osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh/home)

Currently the driver only works when the TabletDriverGUI is running.

The GUI minimizes to system tray / notification area. You can reopen the GUI by double clicking the system tray icon.

## Installation

1. You might need to install these libraries, but usually these are already installed:
    * https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/dotnet-framework-runtime
    * https://aka.ms/vs/15/release/vc_redist.x86.exe

2. Unzip the driver to a folder (Shorter path is recommended, for example `C:\Temp\TabletDriver`)
3. Uninstall all other tablet drivers. If you have problems with uninstalling the Wacom drivers, check the GitHub issue [#1](https://github.com/hawku/TabletDriver/issues/1)
4. Run `install_vmulti_driver.bat`. It might need a restart if there is another vmulti driver installed.
5. If you have Huion or Gaomon tablet, you need to run `install_huion_64.bat`, which is in the `driver_huion` directory.
6. Start the TabletDriverGUI.exe

## Updating to a new version

1. Unzip the new version
2. Start the TabletDriverGUI.exe

## Uninstallation

1. Uncheck the "Run at Windows startup" option in the GUI.
2. Run `remove_vmulti_driver.bat`
3. Run `remove_huion_64.bat`, which is in the `driver_huion` directory.
